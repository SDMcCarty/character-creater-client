## DESCRIPTION

Kartara is an app to help creators keep all of their character information in one place, as well as helping them to create new ones. They can either enter in information for a character they've already created, or generate random prompts to help them round out a character idea. Saved characters can then be updated or deleted as the creator builds and destroys the lives around them.
